Description: interactively select and yank terminal output to stdout or xsel
 Read input from stdin and draw a selection interface where all fields
 in the given input are recognized by using a default or user-supplied
 set of delimiters.

 Using ctrl-n and ctrl-p will move the field selection forward and
 backward, pressing the return key will invoke the yank command and
 write the selected field to its stdin. The yank command defaults to
 xsel, but could be anything that accepts input on stdin.
